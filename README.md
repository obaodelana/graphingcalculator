# Graphing calculator
This is a graphing calculator made with Raylib using C. It allows you to type in an equation and it will display a graph of it. I did it to improve my C skills and it was a lot of fun. I'll add more things as I learn more.

## Math features
- Basic arithmetics (+, -, /, *)
- Basic Trig functions (sin, cos, tan, asin, acos, atan)
- Other functions (sqrt, abs, log, ln)
- Constants and variables (pi, e, x, # (rand))
- ^ (exponents), ! (factorial)

## Typing
- s: sin
- c: cos
- t: tan
- as: asin
- ac: acos
- at: atan
- r: sqrt
- ab: abs
- lo: log
- p: pi
- #: rand
